					Just like everybody else, many of us started our passion with a simple click, a touch or maybe there was a glimpse of light that flashes through our mind guiding us to where we want to be. My photography journey perhaps wasn’t so much different, but I took a step back then a big circle. Now I am on my feet once more, to pick up the camera like I used to. I took a deep breath … It is still what I like to do, free of restrictions, free of resistance.

					Now residing in Brisbane (once again, I know!), I am kinda enjoying the city, the coast, the combination of quietness, and that vibrant neon night life. Who knows if I'm ever in the city where you are living. Give me a shout!

					What more do you want to know about me? I'm a photographer.
